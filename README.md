# CSS Framework

## Introduction
The goal is to build a framework for mid to large scale websites. Which gives a headstart to development and also provides flexibility to scale.

In the short term the goal is to solve some of the basic problems with existing frameworks/libaries such as lack of class prefixes and pre applied theme. But also using the important parts of them like pre-built grids and components. Further more, using ideas from concepts like Atomic CSS, BEM and SMACSS will allow to use the best of both worlds.

In the long term the goal is to allow the community to contribute in providing various modifications of these style. Example, having an option for different grid styles 8-columns, 12-columns, 16-columns and so on.

## Existing Framework Notes

### Atomic CSS
Has predefined class names for various styles that can be used on elements.
* Position
* Paddings / Margins
* Font-size / weights
* Float / Grids / Width
* Text Style
* Borders

### BEM
Use class names as block__element--modifier
